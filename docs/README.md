## Quick Start

1. **Setup**: See [Development Guide](./development-guide.md) for complete setup instructions
2. **Architecture**: Read [Architecture Overview](./architecture-overview.md) to understand system design
3. **Code Organization**: Reference [Folder Structure](./folder-structure.md) for navigating the codebase
4. **AI Features**: Learn about AI integration in [AI Integration](./ai-integration.md)

## Key Features

- **Interactive Canvas**: Design and iterate with unlimited canvas space
- **AI Chat Interface**: Conversational AI for design assistance and content generation
- **Multi-Provider AI**: Seamless integration with local and cloud AI models
- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket-based real-time updates
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support

## Contributing

When working with this codebase:
1. Follow the architectural patterns described in these docs
2. Maintain the feature-based organization structure
3. Use the established development workflows
4. Test across the three-tier architecture (Electron, React, Python)

## Documentation Maintenance

These docs should be updated when:
- New major features or components are added
- Architecture patterns change
- Development workflows are modified
- AI integration patterns evolve
