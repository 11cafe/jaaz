console.log("- Verify restoration ONLY happens when NOT interacting");

console.log("\n❌ Signs of issues:");
console.log("- Videos disappearing during or after interaction");
console.log("- Restoration messages appearing during drag operations");
console.log("- Excessive console logging (more than 1 transform log per second)");
console.log("- Videos jumping or flickering during interactions");

console.log("\n✅ Signs of success:");
console.log("- Videos remain visible during all interactions");
console.log("- Smooth dragging without interruptions");
console.log("- Restoration only occurs when idle (no selection, no dragging)");
console.log("- Minimal console logging during interactions");

console.log("\n🚀 To run this test:");
console.log("1. Start the development server: npm run dev");
console.log("2. Open browser console (F12)");
console.log("3. Generate or load a video on the canvas");
console.log("4. Follow each test scenario above");
